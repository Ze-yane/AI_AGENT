# Smart Manufacturing AI Agents Simulation - AutoParts Inc.

## Overview

This repository demonstrates a **smart manufacturing implementation** for AutoParts Inc., a mid-sized automotive parts manufacturer. The project proposes an AI Agent strategy to address key challenges including:

* 15% defect rate in precision components
* Unpredictable machine downtime
* Rising labor costs and difficulty retaining skilled workers
* Increasing customer demands for customization and faster delivery

The simulation is implemented in **Python** within a **Jupyter Notebook**, representing workflows similar to **Make.com or n8n** automation platforms.

## AI Agent Implementation Strategy

The solution uses **three AI Agents**:

1. **Predictive Maintenance Agent**

   * Monitors machine sensor data to predict failures
   * Sends alerts to maintenance teams for proactive action
   * Reduces unplanned downtime and maintenance costs

2. **Quality Assurance Agent**

   * Analyzes production line components using defect metrics
   * Flags defective components in real-time
   * Reduces defect rate and rework costs

3. **Production Optimization Agent**

   * Optimizes production scheduling based on machine uptime and order demand
   * Balances workforce and resource allocation
   * Increases throughput and ensures timely deliveries

## ROI and Implementation Timeline

**Implementation Phases:**

* **Phase 1 (0–3 months):** Sensor setup and AI model training
* **Phase 2 (4–6 months):** Pilot deployment on select production lines
* **Phase 3 (7–12 months):** Full-scale rollout

**Expected ROI:**

* Quantitative: 10–15% reduction in defect losses, 25–40% reduction in downtime, 15–20% increase in throughput
* Qualitative: Improved employee satisfaction, enhanced customer trust, stronger market competitiveness
